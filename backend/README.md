## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- MySQL 8.0 or higher
- Gradle (or use the included Gradle wrapper)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd java-recipe/backend
   ```

2. **Configure MySQL**
   - Make sure MySQL is installed and running
   - The application is configured to create a database named `javarecipe` if it doesn't exist
   - Update the database credentials in `src/main/resources/application.properties` if needed:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.username=root
     spring.datasource.password=
     ```

3. **Configure Cloudinary (for image upload)**
   - The application is pre-configured with Cloudinary credentials
   - Images are automatically uploaded to the configured Cloudinary account
   - Configuration in `application.properties`:
     ```properties
     cloudinary.cloud-name=duy8dombh
     cloudinary.api-key=352188284543682
     cloudinary.api-secret=dcED4bZAlKhDr1trgPze_9Z1DK8
     ```

4. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

The application will start on port 8080. You can test it by accessing:
- http://localhost:8080/api/test
